I've recently completed my Algorithmic Art course at Université de Montréal, taught by [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/index.html). I suggest you check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rethread-studio/algorithmic-art-course/tree/2025) of the course to fully understand the purpose of these artworks.  It was a wonderful experience exploring a world that was completely new to me. Here are the four artworks I created for this course:

## [Artwork #1 : Generative art with randomness and simple geometric shapes](/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork1/index.html)
The theme was art with randomness and simple geometric shapes, so I wanted to experiment with the library `p5.js` and to test the functions. I wanted to use and represent the evolution of the framerate and the acceleration of the drawings. I also wanted to test the library `p5.sound.js` to generate simple notes.

My inspiration comes mainly from the YouTube channel [Webdriver Torso](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLiV4WJfkTEHH0b9PmRklw).

## [Artwork #2 : Generative art with a specific algorithm](/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork2/index.html)
The theme was art with a specific algorithm. I chose Flow Fields for my algorithm, and I wanted to contrast the relaxing aspects of Flow Fields with glitched or noisy sounds and visuals.

My main inspiration comes from the song 'On Sight' by Kanye West.

## [Artwork #3 : Data driven generative art](/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork3/index.html)

The theme was art with data. I used simple words (see the Dataset section) to represent interactions between individuals. I also used the p5.speech library for text-to-speech (TTS).
