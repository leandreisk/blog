I've recently completed my Algorithmic Art course at Université de Montréal, taught by [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/index.html). I suggest you check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rethread-studio/algorithmic-art-course/tree/2025) of the course to fully understand the purpose of these artworks.  It was a wonderful experience exploring a world that was completely new to me. 

Here are the four artworks I created for this course (To view each work, simply click on the section title) :

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork1/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artwork #1 : Generative art with randomness and simple geometric shapes</a>
The theme was art with randomness and simple geometric shapes, so I wanted to experiment with the library `p5.js` and to test the functions. I wanted to use and represent the evolution of the framerate and the acceleration of the drawings. I also wanted to test the library `p5.sound.js` to generate simple notes.

My inspiration comes mainly from the YouTube channel [Webdriver Torso](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLiV4WJfkTEHH0b9PmRklw).

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artwork #2 : Generative art with a specific algorithm</a>
The theme was art with a specific algorithm. I chose Flow Fields for my algorithm, and I wanted to contrast the relaxing aspects of Flow Fields with glitched or noisy sounds and visuals.

My main inspiration comes from the song 'On Sight' by Kanye West.

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork3/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artwork #3 : Data driven generative art</a>

The theme was art with data. I used simple words (see the Dataset section) to represent interactions between individuals. I also used the p5.speech library for text-to-speech (TTS).

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork4/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artwork #4: Part of the Vernissage – "Exquisite Corpse"</a>

This piece was part of the final vernissage for the course. There are two artworks in this exhibition, and the theme was open. For both pieces, I invite you to explore and interpret the work yourself.

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/Artwork5/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artwork #5: Part of the Vernissage – "Exquisite Corpse"</a>

This is the second piece from the vernissage. Once again, I encourage you to discover the artwork freely.

## <a href="/assets/projects/ift6251/exquis/exquisite-conductor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">End-of-course vernissage: ‘Exquisite Corpse’</a>

The end-of-course vernissage was a collaborative project that brought together all the students. It was inspired by the concept of the [exquisite corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse).  
Each participant had to link their artworks through four connection points placed on the edges of their window. The final installation was displayed across multiple screens, with each window mapped to a specific screen. You can find photos of the exhibition on the course’s GitHub repository.

I’d like to sincerely thank Benoit Baudry and all the students in the course for making this journey both enriching and enjoyable.
